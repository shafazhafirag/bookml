This unique book takes you step-by-step through the disciplined, yet practical, process of architecting truly integrated marketing communications plans that work. In it, you fill find a prescription for building a successful, repeatable campaign development process, including the necessary templates and helpful, practical techniques. This book is your guide that will show you how you can optimize your marketing efforts and achieve an even greater return on your marketing investment. While many of us will recognize a good, well-thought-out marketing campaign when we see one, the single, basic truth about world-class marketing campaign development is that it is easy to say, but hard to do. It is hard to do because we all like to take short-cuts. I hear the lament all too often: \"I'm over-worked don't have the time to think strategically\" or \"Planning is overrated. I just need to get these projects done.\" As a result, we take short-cuts like \"ready, fire, aim.\" Lack of planning is the slippery slope that leads to wasteful marketing. Then one day we get the call from the corner office to come and explain why our marketing efforts did not produce the desired results. Luckily, architecting world-class campaigns is achievable for any marketing team. Successful marketing requires following a disciplined, systematic approach to working cross-functionally and cross-regionally in order to prioritize marketing objectives, design a customer-engaging go-to-market strategy, and execute the plan.\n",

Sidestep the marketing books, courses, and even TED talks that offer hypothetical explanations that sound sensible and embrace the proven, systematic approach of R.E.D. Marketing, which the recent CEO and current CMO of Yum! Brands applied to lead Taco Bell and KFC to double digit growth. This book, filled with simple frameworks and engaging stories, will help everyone in your company understand what really works for driving sustainable brand growth and business success. In 2011, Greg Creed had just been elevated from President to CEO of Taco Bell, a brand in deep distress at the time. It was on his shoulders to turn things around quickly along with co-author and CMO, Ken Muench. Together, they developed the R.E.D (Relevance, Ease, Distinctiveness) method. It’s simple methodology does not require complicated terms and a PhD to understand, it’s actually quite simple—marketing works in three very different ways: Relevance—Is it relevant to the marketplace? Ease—Is it easy to access and use? Distinction—Does it stand out from competition? By combining actual examples from Yum! and other recognizable brands of every size around the world with the latest findings in marketing, neuroscience, and behavioral economics, and the author’s own experience marketing three different brands across 120 countries, your brand can set and achieve a truly breakthrough marketing campaign utilizing R.E.D Marketing.\n",

Praise for the Second Edition: 'I found that the first edition of Brennan, Canning and McDowell's text was excellent for raising students' awareness and understanding of the most important concepts and phenomena associated with B2B marketing. The second edition should prove even more successful by using several new case studies and short 'snapshots' to illustrate possible solutions to common B2B marketing dilemmas, such as the design and delivery of business products and services, the selection of promotional tools and alternative routes to market. The new edition also deals clearly with complex issues such as inter-firm relationships and networks, e-B2B, logistics, supply chain management and B2B branding' - Michael Saren, Professor of Marketing, University of Leicester 'This textbook makes a unique contribution to business-to-business teaching: not only does it provide up-to-date cases and issues for discussion that reach to the heart of business-to-business marketing; it also brings in the latest academic debates and makes them both relevant and accessible to the readers. A fantastic addition to any library or course' - Dr Judy Zolkiewski, Senior Lecturer in Business-to-Business Marketing, Manchester Business School 'The advantage of the approach taken by Brennan and his colleagues is that this book manages to convey both the typical North American view of B2B marketing as the optimisation of a set of marketing mix variables, and the more emergent European view of B2B Marketing as being focused on the management of relationships between companies. This updated second edition sees the addition of a number of 'snapshots' in each chapter that bring the subject alive through the description of current examples, as well as some more expansive end-of-chapter case studies. It is truly a most welcome addition to the bookshelves of those students and faculty interested in this facet of marketing' - Peter Naudé, Professor of Marketing, Manchester Business School 'The strength of this text lies in the interconnection of academic theory with real world examples. Special attention has been given to the role that relationships play within the Business-to business environment, linking these to key concepts such as segmentation, targeting and marketing communications, which importantly encompasses the role personal selling as relationshipmmunications building and not just order taking. With good coverage of international cultural differences this is a valuable resource for both students of marketing and sales' - Andrew Whalley, Lecturer in Business-to-Business Marketing, Royal Holloway University of London 'The text provides an authoritative, up-to-date review of organisational strategy development and 'firmographic' market segmentation. It provides a comprehensive literature review and empiric examples through a range of relevant case studies. The approach to strategy formulation, ethics and corporate social responsibility are especially strong' - Stuart Challinor, Lecturer in Marketing, Newcastle University 'This revised second edition offers an excellent contemporary view of Business-to-Business Marketing. Refreshingly, the text is packed with an eclectic mix of largely European case studies that make for extremely interesting reading. It is a 'must read' for any undergraduate or postgraduate Marketing student' - Dr Jonathan Wilson, Senior Lecturer, Ashcroft International Business School, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge\n",

Entrepreneurial businesses often create products and services based on radically new technology that have the power to change the marketplace. Existing market research data will be largely irrelevant in these cases, making sales and marketing of innovative new products especially challenging to entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurial Marketing focuses on this challenge. Classic core marketing concepts, such as segmentation, positioning, and the marketing mix undergo an ‘extreme makeover’ in the context of innovative products hitting the market. Edwin J. Nijssen stresses principles of affordable loss, experimentation, and adjustment for emerging opportunities, as well as cooperation with first customers. Containing many marketing examples of successful and cutting-edge innovations (including links to websites and videos), useful lists of key issues, and instructions on how to make a one-page marketing plan, Entrepreneurial Marketing provides a vital guide to successfully developing customer demand and a market for innovative new products. This third edition has been thoroughly expanded, including: Expanded content on leveraging digital technologies and their new business models More practical tools, such as coverage of the Lean Canvas model Updated references, cases, and new examples throughout; and, Updated online resources This book equips advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students of marketing strategy, entrepreneurial marketing, and entrepreneurship with the fundamental tools to succeed in marketing.\n",

            "Description: Rand Fishkin, the founder and former CEO of Moz, reveals how traditional Silicon Valley \"wisdom\" leads far too many startups astray, with the transparency and humor that his hundreds of thousands of blog readers have come to love. Everyone knows how a startup story is supposed to go: A young, brilliant entrepreneur has a cool idea, drops out of college, defies the doubters, overcomes all odds, makes billions, and becomes the envy of the technology world. This is not that story. It's not that things went badly for Rand Fishkin; they just weren't quite so Zuckerberg-esque. His company, Moz, maker of marketing software, is now a $45 million/year business, and he's one of the world's leading experts on SEO. But his business and reputation took fifteen years to grow, and his startup began not in a Harvard dorm room but as a mother-and-son family business that fell deeply into debt. Now Fishkin pulls back the curtain on tech startup mythology, exposing the ups and downs of startup life that most CEOs would rather keep secret. For instance: A minimally viable product can be destructive if you launch at the wrong moment. Growth hacking may be the buzzword du jour, but initiatives can fizzle quickly. Revenue and growth won't protect you from layoffs. And venture capital always comes with strings attached. Fishkin's hard-won lessons are applicable to any kind of business environment. Up or down the chain of command, at both early stage startups and mature companies, whether your trajectory is riding high or down in the dumps: this book can help solve your problems, and make you feel less alone for having them.\n",

            "Description: This book is the definitive resource for understanding the phenomena and process of personal brand management as it becomes increasingly valued in a global economy. By providing a research-based, theoretical framework, the author distills the concept of personal branding as it is applicable to individuals throughout all stages of career development as well as across industries and disciplines. Extensively researched with numerous case studies, this book clearly outlines the strategic process of evaluating the economic value of a personal brand to manage and scale it accordingly. The author, an expert in the field of personal brand strategy and management, argues that a business is what a person or organization does, but the brand is what people expect from that person or organization. The two must align, and the book’s conceptual framework explains the theory and practice behind personal branding to accomplish this synergism. The consequence of the digital age is unprecedented visibility for individuals and businesses. As they engage with one another in more and more virtual spaces, the need for understanding and managing the evolving complexity of this ‘personal’ engagement is an economic reality. For this reason, the framework in this title provides insight and perspective on all phases of a brand in its recursive life cycle both on and offline. By providing clarity and structure to the topic as well as practical theory for its application, this title is the ultimate primer on personal branding in theory and practice.\n",

Today, many companies have trouble deciding whether using a truly global marketing strategy is right for them. There is a slight trend back toward localization due to new efficiencies of customization made possible by technology, the Internet, and new manufacturing processes. \"e;Mass Customization\"e; has now taken the place of \"e;Mass Production.\"e; In today's world, the customer does not always respond to a \"e;one size fits all\"e; approach. Global marketing is also a field of study in general business management to provide valuable products, solutions and services to customers locally, nationally, internationally and worldwide. Global Marketing Management equips students with knowledge and skills to enable them to make key management decisions and understand how organisations may be navigated through the increasingly dynamic and challenging global trading environment. Global marketing management is of great importance to a company that is looking to offer its product in an international market. This book will give a high level overview of the planning and organization marketing leaders must address when considering a new country to sell its product in.\n",

            "Description: This is the most practical marketing book you will ever read. It outlines a six-step process that will bring clarity to marketing like you’ve never experienced before. It’s literally a step-by-step guide to more leads, higher sales and a stronger brand. ​The first step is simply being a competent marketer. As the CEO of your organization, this should worry you: Your marketing team knows a lot less about marketing than they let on. And you can prove it in an instant. Ask them to explain the difference between the marketing mix and the promotional mix. It’s a basic question but surprisingly most marketers don’t know the answer. Imagine asking your accounting staff the difference between a balance sheet and an income statement and finding out you stumped them. Now consider this: You can maybe ring another 20% in sales out of your current customers, but that’s offset by the hole in your customer bucket. Real growth comes from new business development and you’ve entrusted a good share of that to a marketing team that can't define a basic marketing term. Not good. I suggest you buy a copy of this book for yourself first. I’ll show you the six steps of Strategically Aimed Marketing or the SAM 6® process for short. It will get you up to speed quickly. Then buy copies for your staff and have them integrate the process into your organization. If you are a marketing manager, writer, graphic designer or anyone else who has a hand in marketing, you should buy this book and beat your CEO to the punch. I’m not kidding when I say The CEO’s Guide to Marketing will make you the smartest marketer in the room. You are going to wish you had this book years ago. Lonny Kocina\n",

            "Description: Proprietary audience development is now a core marketing responsibility. Every company needs audiences to survive. They are where you find new customers and develop more profitable relationships. And yet, most companies today treat their email, mobile, and social media audiences like afterthoughts instead of the corporate assets they are. With AUDIENCE, Jeff Rohrs seeks to change this dynamic through adoption of The Audience Imperative. This powerful mandate challenges all companies to use their paid, owned, and earned media to not only sell in the short-term but also increase the size, engagement, and value of their proprietary audiences over the long-term. As content marketing professionals have discovered, the days of “build it and they will come” are long gone. If you’re looking for a way to gain a lasting advantage over your competition, look no further and start building your email, Facebook, Google, Instagram, mobile app, SMS, Twitter, website, and YouTube audiences to last.\n",

            "Description: The Second Edition of this bestselling B2B marketing textbook offers the same accessible clarity of insight, combined with updated and engaging examples. Each chapter contains a detailed case study to further engage the reader with the topics examined. - Featuring updated case studies and a range of new examples. - Incorporating additional coverage of B2B branding and the B2B strategic marketing process, and issues of sustainability. - Extended coverage of Key Account Management - Online lecturer support including PowerPoint slides and key web links Drawing on their substantial experience of business-to-business marketing as practitioners, researchers and educators, the authors make this exciting and challenging area accessible to advanced undergraduate and to postgraduate students of marketing, management and business studies. Praise for the Second Edition: 'I found that the first edition of Brennan, Canning and McDowell's text was excellent for raising students' awareness and understanding of the most important concepts and phenomena associated with B2B marketing. The second edition should prove even more successful by using several new case studies and short 'snapshots' to illustrate possible solutions to common B2B marketing dilemmas, such as the design and delivery of business products and services, the selection of promotional tools and alternative routes to market. The new edition also deals clearly with complex issues such as inter-firm relationships and networks, e-B2B, logistics, supply chain management and B2B branding' - Michael Saren, Professor of Marketing, University of Leicester 'This textbook makes a unique contribution to business-to-business teaching: not only does it provide up-to-date cases and issues for discussion that reach to the heart of business-to-business marketing; it also brings in the latest academic debates and makes them both relevant and accessible to the readers. A fantastic addition to any library or course' - Dr Judy Zolkiewski, Senior Lecturer in Business-to-Business Marketing, Manchester Business School 'The advantage of the approach taken by Brennan and his colleagues is that this book manages to convey both the typical North American view of B2B marketing as the optimisation of a set of marketing mix variables, and the more emergent European view of B2B Marketing as being focused on the management of relationships between companies. This updated second edition sees the addition of a number of 'snapshots' in each chapter that bring the subject alive through the description of current examples, as well as some more expansive end-of-chapter case studies. It is truly a most welcome addition to the bookshelves of those students and faculty interested in this facet of marketing' - Peter Naudé, Professor of Marketing, Manchester Business School 'The strength of this text lies in the interconnection of academic theory with real world examples. Special attention has been given to the role that relationships play within the Business-to business environment, linking these to key concepts such as segmentation, targeting and marketing communications, which importantly encompasses the role personal selling as relationshipmmunications building and not just order taking. With good coverage of international cultural differences this is a valuable resource for both students of marketing and sales' - Andrew Whalley, Lecturer in Business-to-Business Marketing, Royal Holloway University of London 'The text provides an authoritative, up-to-date review of organisational strategy development and 'firmographic' market segmentation. It provides a comprehensive literature review and empiric examples through a range of relevant case studies. The approach to strategy formulation, ethics and corporate social responsibility are especially strong' - Stuart Challinor, Lecturer in Marketing, Newcastle University 'This revised second edition offers an excellent contemporary view of Business-to-Business Marketing. Refreshingly, the text is packed with an eclectic mix of largely European case studies that make for extremely interesting reading. It is a 'must read' for any undergraduate or postgraduate Marketing student' - Dr Jonathan Wilson, Senior Lecturer, Ashcroft International Business School, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge\n",

            "Description: Create breakthrough marketing campaigns by harnessing the power of R.E.D. Marketing: a transparent and flexible methodology straight from marketing powerhouse Yum! Brands. Sidestep the marketing books, courses, and even TED talks that offer hypothetical explanations that sound sensible and embrace the proven, systematic approach of R.E.D. Marketing, which the recent CEO and current CMO of Yum! Brands applied to lead Taco Bell and KFC to double digit growth. This book, filled with simple frameworks and engaging stories, will help everyone in your company understand what really works for driving sustainable brand growth and business success. In 2011, Greg Creed had just been elevated from President to CEO of Taco Bell, a brand in deep distress at the time. It was on his shoulders to turn things around quickly along with co-author and CMO, Ken Muench. Together, they developed the R.E.D (Relevance, Ease, Distinctiveness) method. It’s simple methodology does not require complicated terms and a PhD to understand, it’s actually quite simple—marketing works in three very different ways: Relevance—Is it relevant to the marketplace? Ease—Is it easy to access and use? Distinction—Does it stand out from competition? By combining actual examples from Yum! and other recognizable brands of every size around the world with the latest findings in marketing, neuroscience, and behavioral economics, and the author’s own experience marketing three different brands across 120 countries, your brand can set and achieve a truly breakthrough marketing campaign utilizing R.E.D Marketing.\n",
